Is the +1 because it is not a *full room* (e.g. a servant quarter or living room) or is the +1 referring to a bathroom? Due to these different possibilities, we follow an iterative approach where for we take 4+1 as 5, 4.5 (to quantify only half a room) and 4 (to quantify no room). We will go with the representation that gives us the most accuracy"

    "We have missing values for bedrooms column. For handling these, we are using scikit-learn class KNN Imputer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNNImputer class provides imputation for filling in missing values using the k-Nearest Neighbors approach. By default, a euclidean distance metric that supports missing values, nan_euclidean_distances, is used to find the nearest neighbors. Each missing feature is imputed using values from n_neighbors nearest neighbors that have a value for the feature. The feature of the neighbors are averaged uniformly or weighted by distance to each neighbor. If a sample has more than one feature missing, then the neighbors for that sample can be different depending on the particular feature being imputed. When the number of available neighbors is less than n_neighbors and there are no defined distances to the training set, the training set average for that feature is used during imputation. If there is at least one neighbor with a defined distance, the weighted or unweighted average of the remaining neighbors will be used during imputation. If a feature is always missing in training, it is removed during transform."
