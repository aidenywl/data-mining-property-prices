# Analysing the Condomium Market in Singapore 

This repo contains the code for our final project in [CS5228](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS5228/knowledge-discovery-and-data-mining) at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. 

Our team is named Data Nerds and our members are Aiden Low, Raivat Shah and Reshma Jawale. 

## System Requirements

* `Python` v3.9 and above 
*  If you're planning to run this on a remote machine, try to optimise/pick machines with a better CPU as against memory (RAM) or GPU as our evidence suggests RAM and GPU aren't as crucial to this code as much as the CPU. We trained using a CPU-optimised Droplet from Digital Ocean. 

## Setup 

Clone the repo (replace the link if you prefer HTTPS links):

```
git clone git@github.com:aidenywl/data-mining-property-prices.git 
cd data-mining-property-prices
```

Setup a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
